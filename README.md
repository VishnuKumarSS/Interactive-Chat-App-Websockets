# Interactive Chat Application
A Django-powered chat application allowing users to create asynchronous chat rooms. Each room is accessible to all users, providing a platform to archive their conversations. Registration and login are mandatory for using the chat application.

Django's channels were utilized to handle asynchronous operations, enabling bidirectional communication between the client and server. This implementation guaranteed smooth message delivery. By leveraging Django's channels, the application facilitated seamless message transmission, greatly enhancing the overall user experience.

Before accessing the chat application's features and engaging in real-time communication, user registration is a necessary initial step.
