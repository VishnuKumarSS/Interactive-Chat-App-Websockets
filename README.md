# Interactive Chat App

A Chat application was developed using the Django framework as the backend server,
allowing users to create asynchronous chat rooms. Each chat room is dedicated to specific
users who have joined, providing a space to store their conversations. To start using the chat
application, users are required to register and login.
Django's channels were utilised to handle asynchronous operations and enable bidirectional
communication between the client and server. This implementation ensured the smooth
delivery of chat messages without disrupting the connection. By leveraging Django's
channels, the application facilitated seamless transmission of messages, enhancing the user
experience.
Before accessing the chat application's features and engaging in real-time communication,
user registration was necessary as the initial step.
